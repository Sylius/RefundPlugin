Hello @Gregcop1! Thank you for your contribution, however, on Sylius repository we manage only English translations. To contribute to other languages, please, use our Crowdin project page - https://crowdin.com/project/sylius :) Good luck üññ

No problem, I didn't know, let's move to this solution. Thanks
I can't find RefundPlugin in the list. Did I missed something? @Zales0123

Woooooow, what has just happened üòÑ Sorry, it's totally my bad, I've just answered automatically and didn't notice it's not a `Sylius/Sylius` repository üíÉ We don't have a Crowdin configured for plugins yet, so definitely it's a proper PR. Sorry for the confusion üññ
