On off-topic note, I hope stable release won't be done until architectural problems are solve as discusses in https://github.com/Sylius/RefundPlugin/issues/193

Hi, PayPlug team here ðŸ‘‹

We are working closely with Synolia in order to release our first Sylius x PayPlug plugin, we are pretty excited to make it happen! ðŸš€

I have two questions for you:
- When will you tag this modification ?
- Regarding your message "Definitely, the next release (hopefully the stable one already ðŸ¤ž) would support Sylius 1.8 only", Does this mean that there is no hope at all to get the refund plugin in a stable version for 1.7 ? Can you explain why ?

Thanks !
