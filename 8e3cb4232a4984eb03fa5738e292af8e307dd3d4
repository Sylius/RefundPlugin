I would vote to drop this ENUM thing entirely. Isn't used in Sylius, so no reason to use over here.

@lchrusciel Would you agree to drop ENUM package? I can add PR for that later on.

I'm in favor of it, but I would like to gather the second vote here. /cc @Zales0123

Dropping the enum -> simplification & consistency -> profit 👌
