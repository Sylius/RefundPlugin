        And channel "United States" billing data is "Haas & Milan", "Pacific Coast Hwy", "90003" "Los Angeles", "United States" with "1100110011" tax ID
        And default tax zone is "US"
        And the store has "US VAT" tax rate of 10% for "Clothes" within the "US" zone
        And the store has "US VAT-SHIPPING" tax rate of 15% for "Shipping" within the "US" zone
        And the store has included in price "VAT" tax rate of 20% for "Mugs" within the "US" zone
        And the store has "Galaxy Post" shipping method with "$10.00" fee
        And shipping method "Galaxy Post" belongs to "Shipping" tax category

        And there is a customer "rick.sanchez@wubba-lubba-dub-dub.com" that placed an order "#00000022"
        And the customer bought a "PHP T-Shirt" and a "Symfony Mug"
        And the customer "Rick Sanchez" addressed it to "Seaside Fwy", "90802" "Los Angeles" in the "United States" with identical billing address

        When I browse the details of the only credit memo generated for order "#00000022"
        Then it should have sequential number generated from current date
        And it should be issued in "United States" channel
