We need to finish a fix for the InvoicePlugin and port that over to this repository as well.

The main problem with this change is that we have a few [embeddables](https://github.com/Sylius/RefundPlugin/blob/8459e05904aa2822be05458f3bebd44959e3d62e/src/Resources/config/doctrine/CreditMemo.orm.xml#L24) used in the doctrine mapping... This is the same bug as here: https://github.com/Sylius/InvoicingPlugin/pull/97. Do you have any idea how it can be fixed? Every help would be helpful, as it for sure needs to be resolved.

I currently have no idea how to fix that and I will probably not get the time to look into that in depth before our setup crashes. ;)

And yes, its the same as https://github.com/Sylius/InvoicingPlugin/pull/97 - I also mentioned this. Can we maybe tag these issues over Refund/Invoice/Rbac Plugin - because Rbac will probably get the same issues as soon as its starting to use embeddables.

Voting to keep the Invioice-Issue as the main discussion though :)

One solution to rule them all: https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusResourceBundle/pull/89

Merging it as it improves the current state of this plugin, though I'll investigate the issue with `CreditMemoSequence`.
